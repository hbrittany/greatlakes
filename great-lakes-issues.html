          Among the leading contributors to sewage overflows: Leaking sewage pipes, malfunctioning sewage treatment plants and pump stations, and aging sanitary and combined sewer systems – which carry raw sewage and stormwater runoff from streets, lawns and fields directly to treatment plants.</p>

                <p class="max screen-s-v screen-m-v screen-l-inv">The Great Lakes and their attendant problems don't recognize municipal or county borders, so why should we? Our Coastal Conservation Program fills an important niche by bringing together multi-jurisdictional stakeholders to restore ailing coastal habitat – the lakes' first line of defense against pollution and a safe harbor for fish and wildlife, no matter where it is. <br> We combine policy-making and scientific know-how to help landowners restore important tributaries and coastal habitats that feed and nourish the Great Lakes. We'll help you assess your natural shoreline assets, develop restoration goals, obtain grants to fund projects that implement those goals, then help with project implementation. Our goal: getting projects off the ground that would otherwise be stymied by the boundary issues that can so often divide today's multi-jurisdictional land restoration efforts.</p>
