                <p class="max screen-s-v screen-m-v screen-l-inv">More than 24 billion gallons of combined untreated sewage and stormwater is dumped into the Great Lakes each year. Bacteria and viruses in untreated sewage pose a significant health risk, and are a major cause of Great Lakes beach closings and swimming advisories. <br>
          Among the leading contributors to sewage overflows: Leaking sewage pipes, malfunctioning sewage treatment plants and pump stations, and aging sanitary and combined sewer systems – which carry raw sewage and stormwater runoff from streets, lawns and fields directly to treatment plants.</p>

                <p class="max">Some 40 million people living in the Great Lakes drainage basin rely on the lakes for drinking water.<br>A one-time gift from the glaciers, the Great Lakes form the largest surface freshwater system on earth – a vast but largely non-renewable resource. As the pressure on fresh water mounts around the world, the Alliance is working to ensure that these waters are maintained and protected.</p>

                <summary class="banner-3">Invasive Species and the Great Lakes</summary>
                <p class="max"> The Alliance released a groundbreaking report in 2008 urging a breakup of the Mississippi River and Great Lakes basins as the only way to permanently stop the devastating Asian carp and other invasives from entering the Great Lakes.<br> The Alliance report, Preliminary Feasibility of Ecological Separation of the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes, outlines six options for separating the watersheds and ending the transfer of species between them. <br>
            The idea of restoring the natural physical barriers that once separated Lake Michigan and the rest of the Great Lakes from the Mississippi River continues to gain momentum.</p>

                <summary class="banner-4">Coastal Conservation</summary>
                <p class="max">The Great Lakes and their attendant problems don't recognize municipal or county borders, so why should we? Our Coastal Conservation Program fills an important niche by bringing together multi-jurisdictional stakeholders to restore ailing coastal habitat – the lakes' first line of defense against pollution and a safe harbor for fish and wildlife, no matter where it is. <br> We combine policy-making and scientific know-how to help landowners restore important tributaries and coastal habitats that feed and nourish the Great Lakes. We'll help you assess your natural shoreline assets, develop restoration goals, obtain grants to fund projects that implement those goals, then help with project implementation. Our goal: getting projects off the ground that would otherwise be stymied by the boundary issues that can so often divide today's multi-jurisdictional land restoration efforts.</p>

                <p class="max">The Alliance for the Great Lakes is dedicated to fostering an ethic of learning, appreciation and care for the Great Lakes. We offer two educational programs: Great Lakes in My World, an educator resource for kindergarten through 12th-grade that addresses Next Generation Science, Common Core and Great Lakes state learning standards, and Adopt-a-Beach™, a service learning and citizen science program tailored to all ages.</p>

                <summary class="banner-6">Sustainable Business</summary>
                <p class="max">The Alliance recognizes that businesses can play pivotal roles in environmental and social sustainability as innovative agents of change. With this in mind, we have developed an adaptive Sustainable Business Department to assist businesses in becoming better stewards of the Great Lakes and the environment. <br> <br>
            In business dollars, the Great Lakes are the catalyst to more than $200 billion in economic activity each year. Protecting and enhancing the Great Lakes for generations of people and wildlife as a whole system of complex and sustaining uses is not only critically needed and implicitly good -- it's also good for business. More and more progressive "green" businesses are proving this every day, and we're helping them do it in the best ways they can.</p>
