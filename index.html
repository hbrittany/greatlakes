  	<p>The Great Lakes contain nearly 20 percent of the earthâ€™s surface freshwater, providing drinking water to more than 40 million people. A 2007 Brookings Institution report determined that a healthy, restored Great Lakes could generate $50 billion in long-term economic benefits for the region. These benefits would be enjoyed by the businesses and industry that use water for commerce, as well as by beachgoers, naturalists, boaters, anglers and homeowners.</p>
  
  	<p>Threats to the Great Lakes today are many, and range from pollution and invasive species to wasteful water use and global warming. All demand our attention and commitment.</p>
