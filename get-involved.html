    <h2>Adobt-a-Beach</h3>
        <p>Adopt-a-Beach™ is the Alliance's premier volunteer program, with nearly 13,000 participants ranging from individuals and families to schools and businesses. More than just a beach sweep, Adopt-a-Beach™ teams clear litter, monitor shorelines and complete a beach health assessment that includes science-based observations and testing. Teams collect information and enter it into our Adopt-a-Beach™ online system to share with local beach authorities, educate the public and improve beaches.</p>
