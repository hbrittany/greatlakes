<h1>Get Involved</h1>

    
<p>Volunteering is a rewarding way to give something back to your community and work with others who, like you, love the Great Lakes! <br> <br>

   <h2>Untreated Sewage Discharges to the Great Lakes</h2>
  <p>More than 24 billion gallons of combined untreated sewage and stormwater is dumped into the Great Lakes each year. Bacteria and viruses in untreated sewage pose a significant health risk, and are a major cause of Great Lakes beach closings and swimming advisories. </p>
  <p>Among the leading contributors to sewage overflows: Leaking sewage pipes, malfunctioning sewage treatment plants and pump stations, and aging sanitary and combined sewer systems -- which carry raw sewage and stormwater runoff from streets, lawns and fields directly to treatment plants.</p>

    <h2>Taking Aim at Algae</h2>
      <p>When algae washes up on Great Lakes beaches, it's a sign there's something wrong. It's unsightly and unhealthy. Algae can grow in massive quantities, fouling beaches for days and clogging water intakes. It can also harbor pathogens like salmonella, or in the case of several blue-green algae species in Lake Erie produce toxins that sicken people.</p>
      <p>Algae also kills fish and other aquatic organisms by lowering oxygen levels in the water. The nutrients we spread on our lawns, gardens and farmfields to spur healthy plant growth similarly spur algae growth in the lakes when carried there in runoff. Nutrients also reach the lakes via untreated sewage discharges and use of phosphorus-based detergents at home.</p>

   <h2>Great Lakes Regional Refinery Expansions</h2>
   <p>British Petroleum in 2007 proposed and received approval from Indiana regulators for increases in pollution levels from BP’s Whiting, Ind., refinery.  The proposal quickly became a bellwether for similar refinery expansion proposals for the Great Lakes basin and beyond, all as a result of the increased use of heavy crude oil derived from tar sands in Canada. The use of these stocks, it was found, was becoming economical to tap and would ease national security concerns because much of the United States' oil comes from unstable Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>The Alliance is now monitoring proposed refinery expansions in the Great Lakes to ensure they are conducted in a manner that reduces and ultimately eliminates pollution over time and enhances quality of coastal habitat consistent with the federal Clean Water Act, key outcomes of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration strategy and Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative standards. Concerned about global warming ramifications from the expansions, the Alliance is also partnering with leading organizations to address these pollutants. The region will require clean energy to support sustained economic development. Wind energy, both onshore and offshore, could be a portion of this energy requirement.</p>

   <h2>Drugs in Drinking Water</h2>
   <p>The Alliance educates people to participate in water quality decisions affecting their health, and works with government agencies, municipalities and businesses to develop strong policies and standards. We also work to ensure agencies use their authority to protect water quality, demanding agency oversight and legal enforcement when necessary.</p>
