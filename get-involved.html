    <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>

    <h2>Adobt-a-Beach</h3>
        <p>Adopt-a-Beach™ is the Alliance's premier volunteer program, with nearly 13,000 participants ranging from individuals and families to schools and businesses. More than just a beach sweep, Adopt-a-Beach™ teams clear litter, monitor shorelines and complete a beach health assessment that includes science-based observations and testing. Teams collect information and enter it into our Adopt-a-Beach™ online system to share with local beach authorities, educate the public and improve beaches.</p>

   <h2>Great Lakes Education</h2>
  <p>The Alliance for the Great Lakes is dedicated to fostering an ethic of learning, appreciation and care for the Great Lakes. We offer two educational programs: Great Lakes in My World, an educator resource for kindergarten through 12th-grade that addresses Next Generation Science, Common Core and Great Lakes state learning standards, and Adopt-a-Beach™, a service learning and citizen science program tailored to all ages.</p>
